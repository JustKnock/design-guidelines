  The systems engineer's dilemma:
  At each cost-effective solution:
  To reduce cost at constant risk, performance must be reduced.
  To reduce risk at constant cost, performance must be reduced.
  To reduce cost at constant performance, higher risks must be accepted.
  To reduce risk at constant performance, higher costs must be accepted.

  In this context, time in the schedule is often a critical resource so that schedule behaves like a kind of cost.
